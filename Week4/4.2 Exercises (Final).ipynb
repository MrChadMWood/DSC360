    "In the text, there’s a text normalizer created – your assignment is to re-create that normalizer as a Python class that can be re-used (within a .py file). However, unlike the book author’s version, pass a Pandas Series (e.g., dataframe[‘column’]) to your normalize_corpus function and use apply/lambda for each cleaning function. (Ask questions in Teams if that’s unclear.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your new text normalizer, create a Jupyter Notebook that uses this class to clean up the text found in the file big.txt (that text file is in the GitHub for Week 4 repository). Your resulting text should be a (long) single stream of text."
